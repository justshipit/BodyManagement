## Concept

#### Introduction

This’ll be a simple game, meant as a simple intro to game dev. Some of our goals:
* Get used to collaborative game dev methods
* Learn Gamemaker and GML to a functional degree
* Resolve any early roadblocks with our tools and workflow
* Have fun :)

Fail state is achieved when any of the bodily functions are not handled within a proper window of time.
